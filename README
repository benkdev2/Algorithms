Collection of algorithms based on challenges from popular coding sites. Some method names will map directly to the challenges.

My method is to try to solve the challenges in 45 minutes. The break down is:

Minutes 0-2: Subtract, since this will be talking to the interviewer

Minutes 2-5: Try to understand the problem, inputs, outputs

Minutes 5-10: Come up with a brute force solution. Try to come up with an alternate solution that will reduce time complexity.

Minutes 10 - around 35: Code the solution.

Minutes 35 to around 45 (leave time for final questions): Run sample input, find and correct bugs/syntax errors.
                                                          Try to think of a better solution
                                                          
Sometimes I take a few hours if I'm practicing something new (such as the WinningCandidate solution, where I was
experimenting with hashcode and compareTo in order to go from O(n^2) to O(n) in time complexity.
